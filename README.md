Here are few points of my PHP Project:

•	In this PHP project when admin login through its username and password only admin gets access of employee and customer page.
•	Only admin is allowed to go to employee page and add employee by filling the details of employee. 
•	Once the admin fills out employee details and add employee then ab alert comes up. 
•	Only Admin is allowed to go to customer page and see the details of employee. 
•	Employee can also login through its username and password.
•	Once the employee login then employee is only allowed to see the customer page and check out the details of the customer.
•	You can download the video to see the whole demonstration of the project.
